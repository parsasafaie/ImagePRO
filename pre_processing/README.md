# Pre-Processing Module

This module provides image preprocessing functions such as resizing, cropping, rotation, grayscale conversion, blurring, sharpening, and contrast enhancement.

## Submodules
- `blur.py`: Functions for applying average, Gaussian, median, and bilateral blurs.
- `contrast.py`: Functions for histogram equalization, CLAHE, and contrast stretching.
- `image_cropper.py`: Crop images to a specified region.
- `grayscale.py`: Convert images to grayscale.
- `image_resizer.py`: Resize images to specific dimensions.
- `rotate.py`: Rotate images by fixed or custom angles.
- `sharpen.py`: Apply sharpening filters like Laplacian and unsharp masking.
